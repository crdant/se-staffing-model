1. Title cell with project overview
2. Introduction cell explaining the workload modeling approach
3. Import cell with all required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ipywidgets)
4. Table of contents cell listing all sections
5. Placeholder cells for each major section as outlined in the spec

Import the following libraries:
- pandas as pd
- numpy as np
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- seaborn as sns
- ipywidgets as widgets
- from IPython.display import display, clear_output

Add basic notebook configuration:
- Set matplotlib to inline mode
- Configure seaborn style for professional appearance
- Set pandas display options for better table formatting

Create a simple test to verify all imports work correctly.
```

### Step 2: Helper Functions Framework
**Goal**: Implement core calculation functions that will be reused throughout the notebook
**Deliverable**: Modular helper functions for all business calculations

```
Create a comprehensive set of helper functions in the notebook for all business calculations:

1. Revenue and pipeline calculation functions:
   - calculate_required_new_logos(quarterly_revenue_goal, average_selling_price)
   - calculate_weighted_win_rate(eval_mix_percentages, win_rates)
   - calculate_required_activities(new_logos_needed, conversion_rates, eval_mix, win_rates)

2. Workload calculation functions:

Test each function with sample inputs to verify correctness.
```

### Step 3: Parameter Management
**Goal**: Define all input parameters with default values and validation rules

```
Create a comprehensive parameter management system:

1. Define parameter dictionaries for each category:
   - revenue_params: quarterly_revenue_goal, average_selling_price
   - conversion_params: opportunity_creation_rate, demo_conversion_rate, tech_eval_conversion_rate
   - eval_mix_params: self_guided_percentage, se_led_percentage, rapid_pov_percentage, no_eval_percentage
   - win_rate_params: self_guided_win_rate, se_led_win_rate, rapid_pov_win_rate, no_eval_win_rate
   - activity_time_params: all time requirements for different activities
   - staffing_params: team structure and allocation parameters
   - account_params: account counts and meeting frequencies
   - strategic_params: strategic activity time allocations

2. Create parameter validation functions:

   - validate_positive_values() - ensures all time/count parameters are positive
   - validate_percentage_bounds() - ensures all percentages are 0-100%

3. Create a central parameter update function:

4. Default parameter values matching the specification exactly

Include comprehensive error messages for validation failures and warnings for edge cases (like >100% utilization).
```

### Step 4: Revenue & Pipeline Calculations
**Goal**: Implement the core business logic for revenue-driven pipeline calculations
**Deliverable**: Working pipeline calculation engine

```
Implement the core pipeline calculation engine:

1. Revenue-to-activity calculation flow:
   - Start with quarterly revenue goal and average selling price
   - Calculate required new logos per quarter
   - Work backwards through conversion funnel to determine required activities
   - Account for different evaluation types and their win rates

2. Pipeline funnel calculations:
   - Calculate weighted average win rate across all evaluation types
   - Determine required evaluations of each type to meet new logo targets
   - Calculate required demos (accounting for demo-to-evaluation conversion)
   - Calculate required opportunities (accounting for opportunity-to-demo conversion)
   - Calculate required initial meetings (accounting for meeting-to-opportunity conversion)

3. Weekly activity breakdowns:
   - Convert quarterly targets to weekly activity requirements
   - Split evaluations by type (self-guided, SE-led, rapid POV, no eval)
   - Calculate SE time requirements for each activity type

4. Time allocation calculations:
   - Demo time: prep + delivery + follow-up
   - Evaluation time: ongoing weekly hours for self-guided/SE-led, total hours for rapid POV
   - Meeting time: including prep time

5. Comprehensive testing:
   - Create test scenarios with known outcomes
   - Validate that pipeline math flows correctly from revenue to activities
   - Test edge cases (very high/low conversion rates, different evaluation mixes)

Include detailed intermediate calculations for debugging and transparency.
```

### Step 5: Account Management Logic
**Goal**: Implement account management workload calculations
**Deliverable**: Complete account management calculation system

```
Implement the account management calculation system:

   - Strategic accounts: monthly meeting frequency × account count
   - Protect accounts: monthly meeting frequency × account count  
   - Growth accounts: monthly meeting frequency × account count
   - Retain accounts: meeting frequency (every X months) × account count

2. New logo onboarding calculations:
   - Monthly onboarding meetings: 50% of new logos × 6 months of meetings
   - Quarterly onboarding meetings: 50% of new logos × 4 quarterly meetings per year
   - Spread new logo meetings across quarters appropriately

3. Meeting time calculations:
   - Base meeting duration + follow-up time per meeting
   - Convert monthly meeting totals to weekly SE hours
   - Account for distribution across available SEs

4. Account portfolio balancing:
   - Calculate total account management load per SE
   - Identify potential over-allocation scenarios
   - Provide recommendations for account distribution

5. Validation and edge case handling:

   - Sales enablement: fixed hours per week  
   - Developer advocacy: handle min/max range (1-2 hours/week)
   - Asset development: average hours per week

2. Role distribution logic:
   - Calculate total strategic hours needed per week
   - Distribute between ICs and Directors based on ic_strategic_percentage
   - Account for Director IC time percentage for Directors doing IC work
   - Handle cases where Directors do both strategic and IC work

3. Capacity allocation:
   - Calculate available strategic time per role type
   - Identify over/under allocation scenarios
   - Provide recommendations for optimal distribution

4. Variable activity handling:
   - For activities with min/max ranges, provide sensitivity analysis
   - Show impact of different allocation choices
   - Default to midpoint for baseline calculations

5. Strategic activity reporting:
   - Hours per activity type per role
   - Total strategic commitment as percentage of capacity
   - Available remaining time for pipeline activities

6. Integration with other calculations:
   - Ensure strategic time commitments reduce available pipeline capacity
   - Account for strategic work in overall utilization calculations

Test various staffing configurations and strategic activity levels.
