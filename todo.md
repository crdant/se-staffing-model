- [ ] **Step 11: Advanced Dashboard** - Professional dashboard with multiple chart types  
- [ ] **Step 12: Results Summary & Export** - Executive summary and export capabilities

## Next Action Items

### Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Start)
1. **Create basic notebook structure** (Step 1)
   - Set up se_staffing_model.ipynb with proper sections
   - Import all required libraries
   - Create table of contents and section placeholders

### Upcoming Dependencies
- Steps 2-3 can be done in parallel after Step 1
- Steps 4-6 require completion of Steps 2-3
- Steps 7-9 require completion of Steps 4-6
- Steps 10-12 require completion of all previous steps

## Key Milestones

- [ ] **Foundation Complete** - Steps 1-3 finished, basic calculation framework ready
- [ ] **Business Logic Complete** - Steps 4-6 finished, all calculations working correctly
- [ ] **Interactive Interface Complete** - Steps 7-9 finished, full widget integration
- [ ] **Final Deliverable Ready** - Steps 10-12 finished, complete professional solution

## Notes & Decisions Made

### Planning Phase Decisions
- Using Jupyter notebook format for maximum business user accessibility
- Implementing comprehensive parameter validation to prevent user errors
- Building modular calculation functions for maintainability
- Focusing on professional visualizations suitable for executive presentations
- Including export capabilities for sharing results outside the notebook

### Technical Decisions
- Using ipywidgets for interactive controls
- Pandas/numpy for calculations
- Matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations
- Implementing real-time updates for immediate feedback
- Creating comprehensive validation system

## Risk Items & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Complexity Risk**: Many interdependent calculations could lead to bugs
   - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing at each step, modular design
2. **Performance Risk**: Real-time updates with complex calculations
   - *Mitigation*: Optimization strategies, caching, efficient algorithms
3. **Usability Risk**: Too complex for business users
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive validation, clear error messages, intuitive design

### Validation Strategy
- Test each calculation function against manual calculations
- Create comprehensive test scenarios covering edge cases
- Validate final results against known business scenarios
- User acceptance testing with actual business stakeholders

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Potential Future Features
- [ ] Scenario comparison and saving functionality
- [ ] Advanced sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Integration with external data sources
- [ ] Automated report generation and scheduling
- [ ] Multi-team/multi-region modeling capabilities

## Team & Responsibilities

### Implementation Team
- **Technical Implementation**: Code generation LLM following detailed prompts
- **Business Validation**: To be determined (business stakeholder review)
- **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive automated and manual testing per step

### Review & Approval Process
- Each step requires validation before proceeding to next step
- Business logic validation at end of Phase 2
- User experience validation at end of Phase 3
- Final acceptance testing at end of Phase 4
